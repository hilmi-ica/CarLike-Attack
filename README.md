# Car-Like Vehicle under Sensor Attacks

This repository contains a numerical simulation for path-following of a car-like vehicle under sensor attack, focusing on estimating both the real state and attack magnitudes. The simulation and its analysis are designed as part of the research requirements for an IEEE Transactions on Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems paper. To run the normal simulation, use the ```CarLikeSim.m``` file . Additionally, for running Monte Carlo simulations, use the ```CarLikeMC.m``` file.
